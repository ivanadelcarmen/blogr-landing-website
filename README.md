# **Blogr landing page using HTML, CSS, and jQuery**

## Abstract

For the following website I applied basic to intermediate CSS, along with a well-structured HTML code, to match the colors, sizes, and grid positions showcased in the designs found in the `design` folder and taken from the original idea at the link to this [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blogr-landing-page-EX2RLAApP). The dropdown menus' functionality was written using JavaScript, specifically with the jQuery library to add dynamism. Additionally, different CSS and JS settings were applied for smaller screen sizes resembling tablets or mobile phones, making the website responsive.
